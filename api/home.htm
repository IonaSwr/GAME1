    Server side rendering :


    Server state - like the memory for a multi player game , 
        will be restarted when the server will be restarted ,
        but the update will be local and sent to the server to ,
        the client will download it at the restart or on interval when someone else changed the data .        
    Controller state - on the server and with local storage on the client side .
    Local state - on the server and with local storage on the client side .
    Client state - will be active only from the window refresh .


    We want the application to be server side renderingg but we want to make all the users to be able to 
    edit data together on the same enviroment . when some one is using the application the other users 
    will be able to look on his work and they will look on the same page for that user and they will look 
    what he is doing live .

    The main goal is to make a chess game online , and all players can spectate on the game.
